# Resume Analyzer
Python scripts to analyze a federal sector resume and provide basic feedback

## Usage
1. Make sure you have installed the latest version of Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download the files from this repository by clicking the green `Clone or Download` button in the top right of the window and selecting `Download ZIP`.
3. Unzip the folder
4. Run the `setup.py` file by double-clicking it. You only have to do this the first time you run the reviewer.
6. Add any resumes to be reviewed into the `resumes` folder. The program will only detect resumes if they are inside this folder.
6. Run the `reviewer.py` file by double-clicking it. This is the main application of the reviewer and will be the only file you run when continuing to use the reviewer.


## TODO
1. Look into grammar/punctuation/spelling python libraries
2. Make sure reviewer will put resume into a folder called 'resumes' and that code has functionality for that folder change (rather than test_data)
