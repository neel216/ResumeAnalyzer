# Resume Analyzer
Python scripts to analyze a federal sector resume and provide basic feedback

## TODO
1. Look into grammar/punctuation/spelling python libraries
2. Make sure reviewer will put resume into a folder called 'resumes' and that code has functionality for that folder change (rather than test_data)
